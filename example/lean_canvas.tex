\section*{Problem}
Consumers lack transparency about the true lifetime cost of electronic products, household appliances, automobiles, including energy and maintenance expenses. This leads to suboptimal purchasing decisions and higher long-term costs.

\section*{Customer Segments}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Environmentally and cost-conscious consumers
  \item Online shoppers on saturn.de and digitec.ch
  \item People comparing appliances and electronics
\end{itemize}

\section*{Unique Value Proposition}
A Chrome extension that instantly reveals the total lifetime cost (purchase, energy, maintenance) of products on major e-commerce sites, empowering smarter, greener buying decisions.

\section*{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Extract product and energy data directly from product pages
  \item Calculate lifetime costs using user preferences and real data
  \item Display results in a clear, actionable popup
\end{itemize}

\section*{Channels}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chrome Web Store
  \item Social media and tech blogs
  \item Word of mouth and user recommendations
\end{itemize}

\section*{Revenue Streams}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Free extension (potential for premium features or donations)
  \item Affiliate links or partnerships with eco-friendly retailers (future)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Cost Structure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Development and maintenance
  \item API usage (e.g., Gemini API)
  \item Marketing and support
\end{itemize}

\section*{Key Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Number of active users
  \item Number of product analyses performed
  \item User feedback and ratings
\end{itemize}

\section*{Unfair Advantage}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Seamless integration with major e-commerce sites
  \item AI-powered data extraction for broad compatibility
  \item Customizable user preferences for accurate results
\end{itemize}
